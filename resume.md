## Education 
([click to see how I wasted my years][time])

__2001.9~2005.7:__ Hebei University of Science & Technology

During my under graduate study, my major was [_Electrical
Engineering_][electricalengineering]. To do [motor contol][motor] and
[automation][automation], we had a course on _C languange_ (2002) and later
learned two assembles, one for [MSC-51][mcs51](2004), the other
[8086][8086](2004) I also learned [PLC][plc] programming(2003). 
Single thread programming, close to the hardware. But this changed when I
started my postgraduate life in:

__2006.9~2009.3:__ North China Electric Power University

I did reserch on developing  _Vibration data acquisition instruments_ to be
used in power plants, we started with _80C51F_, linking against the C lib that
came with it. Later, we switched to 32-bit ARM chip S3C2410. For the sake of 
multithreading and GUI support, we needed a real kernel to settle the chaos, I
picked up Linux(while some guys chose WinCE), and that changed my life. I
spent most of my time on two things:

 - Linux driver for ARM(s3c24x0) chips.  
 - UI implemented with [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/)

## Me in real world

__2009.3~2009.12:__ [Asianux Ltd][asianux]

Maintainer of [AXTU][axtu], and later wrote a authentication plugin for
[YUM][yum], in order to use it in Asianux4.0.

__2008.7~present:__ [Beijing Linux User Group][blug]

 - manager of [Embedded Linux Group][elg]
 - manager of [GitBeijing][gitbeijing]
 - member of  [Quadcopter Group][quad]

## Project Summary

__2006.12~2008.11:__ [Tinylion][tinylion]

I am the founder of this project. Open source hardware &
software. Drivers and apps in C.


__2008.12~present:__ [Tata][tata]

Tata is a Qt project aiming at developing a data analysis program for
scientific use. It contains wave form display and other data analysis
functions. Initially designed to work on embedded platform as part of Tinylion.

__2009.3~2009.10:__ [AXTU][axtu]

AXTU is a Linux system updater, based on RPM, it has similiar work flow as
YUM, but implemented in C++(Qt), it was created by Hansoft engineers, long
time before I joined the development. What I added was:
 
 - epoch handling
 - obsolete tag handling

__2010.1~present:__ [Gitbro][gitbro]

My deep love for [git-scm][git-scm] resulted in this project. Building GUI front-end with Qt, scripting my own work flow, and posting what I've learned at [GitBeijing][gitbeijing]. 

__2008.8~2008.9:__ [Hen][hen]

My tiny projects of interest are safe here as "eggs" :-)

 - YUM plugin 
 - Meego and Andriod 
 - Network Manager 
 - MoinToMuse convertor(writen in python)
 - and [more][hen]
